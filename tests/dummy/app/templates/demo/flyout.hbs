              This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy
              for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were
              largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole
              it was not the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
